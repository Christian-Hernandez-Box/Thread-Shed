# Thread-Shed

Youâ€™ve recently been hired as a cashier at the local sewing hobby shop, Thread Shed. Some of your daily responsibilities involve tallying the number of sales made during the day, calculating the total amount of money made, and keeping track of the names of the customers.

Unfortunately, the Thread Shed has an extremely outdated register system and stores all of the transaction information in one huge, unwieldy string called daily_sales.

All day, for each transaction, the name of the customer, amount spent, types of thread purchased, and date of sale are all recorded in this same string. Watch me clean up each transaction and store all the information in easier-to-access lists using my newly acquired Python skills.
